## Description

This is a training project as a part of the "Professional Front-End Web Development" nano-degree program.

It focuses mainly on applying the newly learned Java Script skills, and 
incoporating them to the previously learned HTML and CSS.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. Then it was converted from a static project to an interactive one primarily by modifying the JavaScript file.

## Usage

Simply open the index.html. Notice how the sections in view get highlighted, and the nav items get distinguished.

## Dependancies

No extra libraries required to run the project code. Just make sure the 
files are in the right relative paths.
